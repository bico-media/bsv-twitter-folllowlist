BSV Twitter Followlist
=====================================

What is This?
----------------

There are several thousand accounts on Twitter that propagate narratives on behalf of an 
idea even if it originated with a  man who some consider a a serial con artist, document 
forger, plagiarist, and pathological liar. These accounts are probably worth following on 
Twitter.

The accompanied CSV in this repository was generated by performing a graph analysis of 
accounts based upon their interactions with each other. While its accuracy is surely less 
than 100%, a manual review of random accounts on the list show it to have a low rate of false 
positives.

Note: it's not possible to algorithmically analyse intent or support via graph analysis. 
All we can tell is that there are a ton of connections and interactions within the BSV social graph. 
As such, some anti-BSV accounts that have embedded themselves deeply into the BSV social graph 
will be included in the results.

How Do I Use It?
----------------

If you are technically savvy you may use the provided CSV.

If you want a more user-friendly version then you may authorize my 
Twitter app (coming soonâ„¢) to follow the accounts from the CSV. Be aware that due to 
rate limits imposed by the Twitter API, it will take as long as 12 hours to complete.

This list is algorithmically generated. Human edits / subjectivity will not be accepted because it's a 
slippery slope down which I do not wish to venture. Feel free to fork and curate your own.
